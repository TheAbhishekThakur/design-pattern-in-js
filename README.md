# Design Pattern

Design patterns are not algorithms or specific implementations. They are more like ideas, opinions, and abstractions that can be useful in certain situations to solve a particular kind of problem.

Design patterns are classified into three main categories: 

- Creational Design Patterns
- Structural Design Patterns
- Behavioral Design Patterns 


## Creational Design Patterns

 - Factory Method Pattern
 - Abstract Factory Pattern
 - Builder Pattern
 - Prototype Pattern

## Structural Design Patterns

 - Adapter Pattern
 - Decorator Pattern
 - Facade Pattern
 - Proxy Pattern

## Behavioral Design Patterns

 - Chain of Responsibility Pattern
 - Iterator Pattern
 - Observer Pattern
