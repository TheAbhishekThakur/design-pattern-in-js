# Design Pattern

Design patterns are not algorithms or specific implementations. They are more like ideas, opinions, and abstractions that can be useful in certain situations to solve a particular kind of problem.

Design patterns are classified into three main categories: 

- Creational Design Patterns
- Structural Design Patterns
- Behavioral Design Patterns 


## Creational Design Patterns
These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation. They abstract the instantiation process, making it more flexible and independent of the system.

 - Singleton Pattern
 - Factory Method Pattern
 - Abstract Factory Pattern
 - Builder Pattern
 - Prototype Pattern

## Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns deal with object composition, forming relationships between objects to create larger, more complex structures. They help to define how objects and classes can be combined to form new structures and provide new functionality.

 - Adapter Pattern
 - Decorator Pattern
 - Facade Pattern
 - Proxy Pattern

## Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with communication between objects, defining how they interact and distribute responsibilities. These patterns help you design systems where objects collaborate in a more flexible and efficient manner.

 - Chain of Responsibility Pattern
 - Iterator Pattern
 - Observer Pattern
